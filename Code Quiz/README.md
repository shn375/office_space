# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This program is used as a day-event planner that is designed to take user input and save it. It displays the current date and times that range from 9am to 5pm. When the user types an event into the description box and presses the save button, the browser will save that event so that it won't be lost after refreshing the page. Unavaliable times or times that have already passed are unusable, indicated by the grey box it gets. The current time is displayed by the description box being red, and any times that are in the future are indicated by the description box as green.

These actions can be done by using the script command "localStorage" along with the extensions .setItem and .getItem in order to save the user input and retrieve it later for display. The color of the textarea could be manipulated by targetting the textarea class and putting it through a loop and checking what time it is for the corresponding input. When comparing it to the current time, it would change to the correct color. By default, the color of the textarea box was set to the past and was indicated by the grey color.
